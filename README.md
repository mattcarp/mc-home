# Home Control — Claudette-Powered Smart Home

**Not Alexa. Not Google Home. Yours.**

A smart home system built around Claudette (Claude-based AI) as the brain. 
Natural conversation replaces wake words and rigid commands. 
Your hardware, your data, no cloud dependency.

## The Vision

After 10 years of talking to Alexa like a child ("ALEXA. TURN. ON. THE. LIGHTS."),
this is how smart home should work:

> "Hey, it's getting dark and I'm about to sit down for dinner — can you sort the lights and maybe put some quiet music on?"

That's it. That's the whole interaction.

## Architecture

- **Brain:** Claudette (via OpenClaw)  
- **Device layer:** Home Assistant  
- **Voice input:** Touchscreen devices with mic/speaker (Malta hardware)  
- **UI:** Mission Control tab + standalone dashboard  
- **No cloud:** Everything runs on your own hardware

## Status

🚧 Epic planning phase — see GitHub Issues for the roadmap.
